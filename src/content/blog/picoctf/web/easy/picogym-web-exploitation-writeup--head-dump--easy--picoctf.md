In this writeup, we’ll take on the **“head-dump”** challenge from **picoCTF 2025**, created by **Prince Niyonshuti N.**. The challenge involves exploring a simple blog web application to discover an endpoint that exposes a memory dump file containing a hidden flag.

Let’s get into it and see what secrets the server’s memory holds!

After launching the challenge instance, I started by browsing through the website, carefully checking the pages, links, and possible hidden paths.

In the challenge description, it specifically mentioned an article about **API Documentation**. So, I clicked on **#API Documentation**, which took me to the /api-docs/ page. This page had **Swagger UI**, a tool used to test and explore API endpoints.

Inside Swagger UI, I noticed several API endpoints listed. Since the challenge is called **head-dump**, the /heapdump endpoint under the **diagnosing** section immediately stood out.

I used the **Try it out** button in Swagger UI for the /heapdump endpoint and executed it. The server responded with a download link for a file named something like: heapdump-1746774321051.heapsnapshot

I downloaded the file, which turned out to be quite large. Since **picoCTF flags** are always in the format picoCTF{}, I decided to search the file for this pattern using the grep command:

> cat heapdump-1746773498002.heapsnapshot | grep picoCTF

And we got the flag!

**Flag:** picoCTF{Pat!3nt\_15\_Th3\_K3y\_f1179e46}
